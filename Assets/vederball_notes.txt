INTRO SCREEN:
=====================
YOU ARE A FUNHAUS FAN OF THE FUNHAUSES, AND YOU HAVE BEEN ZAPPED INTO HAUSBALL!

Rules: Use the UP and DOWN arrow to move FUNHAUS MAN along the goal line. FUNHAUS MAN is to try to stop the Hausballs from getting past him. If a Hausball does go by, than FUNHAUS MAN looses a Hauslife. FUNHAUS MAN only has three Hauslives!

Also, FUNHAUS MAN gets Hauspoints for saving a ball! Each save gets him 5 Hauspoints!
Each GOAL on the other net gets FUNHAUS MAN even MORE Hauspoints!
